Performed an ASIC Design flow for UART including design, verification and physical design.
∗ Developed the interface with a customizable baud generator, transmitter, FIFO with a parity-bit checker, and a receiver.
∗ Also, the design is simultaneously taken to GDSII by using OpenLane, an open-source flow from RTL to GDSII with a
skywater 130nm technology node.
∗ The UART is verified by a UVM environment having a scoreboard, sequencer, driver, and monitor.
